      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p> I am a front-end user that is tech-savy, loves his family, and enjoys the Florida weather. I love to eat delicious Colombian food (where I'm originally from,) and adore to play video games. Also, it might not be obvious since all you are seeing is text,
      but I am also an Identical triplet too, and the perks of having two best friends with you is amazing!</p>
      <p>Family, friends, and my thirst for tech knowledge (be it from learning about new programs, languages, and skills,) are very important to me. Last but not least, respect is incredibly important in my life, and I whole-heartedly follow the rule "do unto
      others as you would like to done unto you".
